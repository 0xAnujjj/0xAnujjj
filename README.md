# Hi, I'm Anuj 👋

I build small machines of thought—code that listens, systems that learn.  
Turning noise into pattern, friction into function, ideas into infrastructure.

- Coding. Learning. Shipping.
- Occasionally writing.

## Currently exploring
- Dart + Flutter (app dev)
- Data science with Python (NumPy), MATLAB
- 3D creation: Blender, Onshape (rendering)
- Automations with n8n

## Projects
New here—projects coming soon. I’ll share experiments as I learn.

## Tools & environments
- Languages/Stacks: Dart, Python, MATLAB
- 3D: Blender, Onshape
- Automations: n8n
- Editor/IDE: VS code

## How I learn
- Start small, build often
- Document progress
